# STEMCraft Inventories

This plugin enables separate inventories for different worlds and game modes on Minecraft servers. Key features include:

- **World-Specific Inventories**: Players have distinct inventories for each world, preventing item transfer between unrelated game areas.
- **World Grouping**: Worlds are grouped based on their names, with inventories shared within each group (ie world, world_nether and world_the_end all share the same inventories).
- **Game Mode Separation**: Players have a separate inventory for different game modes (e.g., survival, creative) within the same world.
- **More Than Inventories**: When switching inventories, the complete players profile is switched including health, hunger, effects, etc.
- **Stored As YAML**: Data is stored in the YAML format to use the built-in server serialization methods and should limit issues with future versions.

## Commands

### /clearinventory
The /clearinventory command removes all items from a player's inventory, including their hotbar, main inventory, and armor slots.

#### Usage
/clearinventory [player]

#### Arguments
player (optional): The name of the player whose inventory you want to clear. If not specified, it clears your own inventory.

#### Behavior
- If no player is specified, the command clears the inventory of the player who executed it.
- When run from the console, a player name must be provided.

#### Permission
Requires the `stemcraft.inventory.clear` permission to use this command.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use this command with caution, as it permanently removes all items from the specified player's inventory without any way to undo the action


## Data Storage

Player data is stored in YAML files in /worlds/\<world-name\>/\<player-uuid\>.yml in a serialized format.

While this can be modified using a text editor, it is not recommended as it could break the players inventory restoration.
